To run MadGraph 5 using the command line interface:
--------------------------------------------
./bin/mg5
Type "help" for list of commands and "help [command]" for help
on individual commands. 
Type "tutorial" for an interactive quick-start tutorial.


To run from an MG/ME installation:
----------------------------------
Install MadGraph 5 in directory "madgraph5" under the MG_ME directory.
Make a copy of the Template. Modify the Cards/proc_card.dat, and run:
./bin/newprocess_mg5
After completed process generation, you will find the sequence of
commands used by MG5 in the file Cards/proc_card_mg5.dat.
*Note*: You need MG/ME v. 4.4.44 or later.
*Warning*: For decay chains in MG5, coupling orders refer to the core
process only, while in MG4 they refer to the complete process
including decays. Please modify the proc_card.dat accordingly.


To run the test suite:
----------------------
  A) the unit_tests:
      ./tests/test_manager.py [--verbose=1] [--logging=INFO]
  B) the acceptance tests:
      Go to a recent MG_ME directory, setup MG5 in madgraph5/ and run:
      ./madgraph5/tests/test_manager.py -p tests/acceptance_tests
  C) the parallel tests (warning - this will take a LOOONG time!):
      ./madgraph5/tests/test_manager.py -p tests/parallel_tests
     (Please check the files in madgraph5/tests/parallel_tests to choose
      running of individual tests)
Run individual tests by specifying the test name.
